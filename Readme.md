## NODE JS

Node.js is a powerful `javascript runtime` that allows developers to build scalable, networked applications using JavaScript. It provides a set of core modules that offer essential functionalities for various tasks, such as working with buffers, file systems, streams, and event emitters.

This repository serves as a collection of practice code for exploring and understanding these core modules. Each module is implemented in a separate script to demonstrate its functionality and usage.
