# Node.js

## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime that allows developers to build scalable, networked applications using JavaScript. It provides a set of core modules that offer essential functionalities for various tasks, such as working with buffers, file systems, streams, and event emitters.

This repository serves as a collection of practice code for exploring and understanding these core modules. Each module is implemented in a separate script to demonstrate its functionality and usage.

## Buffer

Explore the Buffer module, which provides a way to handle binary data directly in Node.js. The [buffer.js](buffer/buffer.js) script demonstrates various operations related to buffers.

## File System

Delve into the File System module, offering capabilities for interacting with the file system. The [filesystem.js](file-system/filesystem.js) script showcases common file operations.

## Streams

Understand the Streams module, which enables efficient handling of data flows. The [streams.js](streams/streams.js) script demonstrates the usage of readable and writable streams.

## Event Emitter

Learn about the Event Emitter module, a fundamental building block for creating custom events in Node.js. The [event-emitter.js](event-emitter/event-emitter.js) script illustrates the basic usage of event emitters.
